# Project Overview

In this project, I use a combination of different **Python** libraries to analyze **car sales data**. I create a **linear regression model** to predict the price of a used car based on the carâ€™s brand, engine volume, and mileage. I completed this project as a part of my [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/).
